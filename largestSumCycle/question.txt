Problem Description :- Largest Sum Cycle
Given a maze with N cells.
 Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit(i.e entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves).
You are given an array Edge[] of N integers, where Edge[i] contains the cell number that can be reached from of cell i in one step. 
Edge[i] is -1 if the ith cell doesnâ€™t have an exit.


The task is to find :- the sum of the largest sum cycle in the maze(Sum of a cycle is the sum of node number of all nodes in that cycle).
Note:- The cells are named with an integer value from 0 to N-1. If there is no node pointing to the ith node then weight of the ith node is zero.

INPUT FORMAT :-
The first line contains the number of cells N.
The second line has a list of N values of the edge[ ] array, where edge[i] conatins the cell number that can be reached from cell 'i' in one step. edge[i] is -1 if the ith doesn't have ans exit.

OUTPUT FORMAT :
First line denotes length of the largest cycle..
Sample Input :
23
4 4 1 4 13 8 8 8 0 8 14 9 15 11 -1 10 15 22 22 22 22 22 21
Sample Output :
6
