Maximum Weight Node:

[ Return a node which has maximum indegree edges ]

[ its is directed Graph]

Problem Description : You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit (i.e. entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves).


The cells are named with an integer from 0 to N-1.
You have to find : Find the node number of maximum weight node (Weight of a node is the sum of all nodes pointing to that node).

INPUT FORMAT :
The first line contains the number of cells N.
The second line has a list of N values of the edge[ ] array, where edge[i] conatins the cell number that can be reached from cell 'i' in one step. edge[i] is -1 if the ith doesn't have ans exit.

OUTPUT FORMAT :
First line denotes the node number with maximum weight node.
Sample Input :
23
4 4 1 4 13 8 8 8 0 8 14 9 15 11 -1 10 15 22 22 22 22 22 21
Sample Output :
22
