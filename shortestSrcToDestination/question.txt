Given a 2D binary matrix A(0-based index) of dimensions NxM.
 Find the minimum number of steps required to reach from (0,0) to (X, Y).

Note: You can only move left, right, up and down, and only through cells that contain 1.

Input:
N=3, M=4
A=[[1,0,0,0], 
   [1,1,0,1],
   [0,1,1,1]]
X=2, Y=3 

Output:
5
Explanation:
The shortest path is as follows:
(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3).
